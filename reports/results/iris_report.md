- Key insights: Highlight which models performed best, the effect of feature scaling, and the distinctiveness of the species based on the pairplot.

- Model performance: Use tables to summarize metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

- Next steps: Suggest potential improvements (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, handling feature overlaps).
